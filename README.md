## Description
A frogger-like game developed with JavaScript.

## Gameplay
### Objective
The objective of the game is to manuever your character from the grass area to the water without being hit by vicious paper cranes. They eat people. Seriously.

### Controls
* The arrow keys on your keyboard move the character up, left, down or right one tile at a time. If you prefer, you may use the W, A, S and D keys for these same functions.
* If the game ends, you may restart the game by pressing the Y key.

### Rewards
* Each time you reach the water safely, you advance to the next level and improve your score.
* Touching gems with your character awards massive score bonuses.
* You earn an extra life for each fifth level you reach. You also earn an extra life when you reach a score of 10,000 points, and each time you earn 10,000 points beyond that.

### Challenges
* Watch out for paper cranes! If one hits you, you lose a life and your character returns to the bottom of the screen. Plus, it's embarrassing being eaten by a paper bird!
* The paper cranes move faster each time you advance to a new level, but the level bonus and gem bonus also increase significantly. At level 10 or higher it becomes harder to cross safely to the water, but each gem you collect will award an extra life.
* The game ends when all lives have been exhausted.
